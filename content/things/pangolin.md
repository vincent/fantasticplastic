In fact, humans are the murderers of this disaster, superstition and greed are the main reason to cause this massacre.
Pangolins, the mammals covered in tough and overlapping scales, are actually far from aggressive. Their scales provide good defense against predators in wild. However, they’re considered the world’s most hunted animal because people believe that the meat is prized for medicinal ingredient and the scales help curl impotence.


Nowadays, the numbers of pangolins are less and less, some people eat them only for the reason of showing their ostentatious wealth, what they do to these helpless animals is to make them approach to endangered. Although International trade in pangolins has been banned by CITES since 2000; and are listed them as 'protected species' in most Asian home states, scaly anteaters are still threaten with smuggling and poaching. Pangolins’ disappear would not be the result we expect to see, only when strictly implement of law enforcement on punishing these poachers and pangolin-eaters would effectively bring down the crisis of extinction. This is our latest chance to save pangolins, and please never make science predictions come true.
